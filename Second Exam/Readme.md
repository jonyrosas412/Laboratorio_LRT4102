## Introduction

This report presents a comprehensive evaluation of a waypoint‐based navigation controller implemented in TurtleSim. The primary turtle (`turtle1`) visits four auxiliary turtles located at the corners of the simulation canvas and then returns to its starting position. During the mission, we collected three core performance metrics—path deviation, completion time, and number of unsafe transitions—and additional auxiliary metrics to provide deeper insight into system behavior.

## Environment and Requirements

The evaluation was conducted on Ubuntu 20.04 with ROS Noetic and Python 3.6+. Required ROS packages include: `turtlesim`, `rospy`, `turtlesim.msg`, and `geometry_msgs.msg`. Ensure your ROS workspace is properly configured and sourced before running the experiment.

## Installation and Execution

Clone the repository into your ROS workspace (`~/catkin_ws/src`), build with `catkin_make`, and source the setup script:

```bash
cd ~/catkin_ws/src
git clone <repo-url> turtlesim_eval
cd ~/catkin_ws
catkin_make
source devel/setup.bash
```

Launch the simulation and evaluator:

```bash
roscore
rosrun turtlesim turtlesim_node
rosrun mi_robot_nodo evaluation.py
```

Terminal logs will display real‐time performance metrics as the turtle navigates.

## Code Overview

The Python script begins by resetting the environment: it kills and respawns `turtle1` at (5.5, 5.5) and branches off four auxiliaries at (2,2), (8,2), (8,8), and (2,8). The node subscribes to `/turtle1/pose` for pose updates and publishes velocity commands to `/turtle1/cmd_vel`. Each navigation step uses a proportional controller, computing linear velocity as:

$$
v = k_v \cdot d
$$

and angular velocity as:

$$
\omega = k_\omega \cdot \Delta\theta
$$

where \$d\$ is the distance to the target waypoint and \$\Delta\theta\$ is the angular error. On-the-fly, the code evaluates metrics such as path deviation and unsafe transitions. Below is the core function used for calculating path deviation directly within the code:

```python
import math

def line_deviation(p, a, b):
    """Compute perpendicular distance from point p to line segment AB."""
    x0, y0 = p
    x1, y1 = a
    x2, y2 = b
    numerator = abs((y2 - y1)*x0 - (x2 - x1)*y0 + x2*y1 - y2*x1)
    denominator = math.hypot(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)
    return numerator / denominator if denominator > 0 else 0.0
```

## Definition of Performance Metrics

We defined the following metrics to assess navigation performance:

**Path Deviation** measures the maximum perpendicular distance between the turtle's actual position and the ideal line between waypoints. Given a point \$P(x\_0,y\_0)\$ and a line through \$A(x\_1,y\_1)\$ and \$B(x\_2,y\_2)\$, deviation is calculated by:

$$
\mathrm{Deviation}(P,AB) = \frac{|(y_2 - y_1)x_0 - (x_2 - x_1)y_0 + x_2y_1 - y_2x_1|}{\sqrt{(y_2 - y_1)^2 + (x_2 - x_1)^2}}.
$$

**Completion Time** is the elapsed time from the first movement command until the turtle returns to its origin. **Unsafe Transitions** count the number of times the deviation exceeds a safety threshold (0.5 m), signaling potential risk. **Navigation Accuracy** is the ratio of ideal path length to actual distance traversed, given by:

$$
\mathrm{Accuracy} = 100\% \times \left(1 - \frac{D_{\mathrm{actual}} - D_{\mathrm{ideal}}}{D_{\mathrm{ideal}}}\right).
$$

Lastly, **Response Time** measures the latency between publishing the first velocity command and the onset of turtle movement.

## Methodology

For simulation, we conducted four independent trials following an identical waypoint sequence, capturing pose and timestamp data via ROS bag recordings. Physical experiments used an Elegoo robot traversing a 3.36 m course under PWM settings of 60, 90, 120, and 150, with energy consumption measured in mAh via a USB power meter. Data processing scripts in Python parsed logs to compute metric summaries, including averages and standard deviations.

## Simulation Setup

TurtleSim operates within an 11×11 coordinate frame. The selected waypoint sequence covers axis-aligned and diagonal segments in the following order: start at (5.5, 5.5), visit (2,2), (8,2), (8,8), (2,8), and return to (5.5, 5.5). This arrangement tests the controller across varying geometries.

## Physical Experiments

The Elegoo platform’s dual DC motors respond to PWM signals. We recorded traversal times for each PWM level and measured energy draw from a 5 V USB power bank, comparing real-world performance against simulation.

## Analysis and Discussion

The proportional controller reliably maintained deviations below 0.5 m except for brief peaks in tight turns, leading to counted unsafe transitions. Completion times under 21 s met simulation criteria, while hardware tests confirmed the expected trade-off between speed and energy draw. The absence of deviation metrics in physical tests highlights the need for odometry integration in future work.

## Conclusions

Our TurtleSim navigation implementation fulfills the original performance objectives of accuracy, efficiency, and safety. While proportional control suffices for basic paths, extending to real-world scenarios will require advanced control strategies and sensor integration.

## Future Work

Planned enhancements include implementing PID control with odometry feedback, integrating global path planning algorithms (e.g., A\*), migrating to Gazebo with simulated sensors, and developing adaptive safety thresholds alongside live monitoring dashboards.
